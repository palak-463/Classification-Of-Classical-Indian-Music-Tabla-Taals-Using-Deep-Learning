Classification of Classical Indian Music Tabla Taals Using Deep Learning

The Tabla Taal Recognition System is a groundbreaking research project that explores the categorization of Classical Indian Music Tabla Taals, including renowned ones such as Addhatrital, Ektal, Rupak, Dadra, Deepchandi, Jhaptal, Trital, and Bhajani. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach with Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), our state-of-the-art model efficiently dissects and categorizes these intricate rhythmic patterns. The system, enriched by training on a diverse set of Classical Indian music recordings, offers a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to upload audio files, providing instant recognition of tabla taals. This project holds significant value in advancing music analysis, serving as a valuable tool for both amateur tabla players seeking to master their art and instructors for effective training purposes.
